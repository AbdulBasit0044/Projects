                <p>The IPL has enjoyed another highly successful season featuring numerous nail-biting last-over finishes and a tension-building scramble among teams vying for a place in the finals</p>.

<p>In its 11th season, the tournament has certainly not lost, and if anything only gained in, lustre. Players from all around the cricketing world are desperate to win a contract and become involved in what is widely considered the most glamorous and definitely the most rewarding of all the T20 leagues.</p>

<p>In addition to the financial benefits the IPL has brought Indian cricket, the league has had a huge positive effect on playing standards. Since the advent of the IPL, Indian national teams have been more confident and aggressive in their approach to the game, and nowhere does this better show up than in their fielding.</p>

<p>The overseas influence on Indian cricket through the IPL has resulted in a more combative national team, confident in its ability to match it with any opposition. There's nothing like playing with and against international stars on a regular basis to help young players discover that despite their great skill, these lauded individuals are still vulnerable to a good delivery or capable of bowling the odd bad ball.</p>

<p>Where a young Indian player in the past often lusted after a meeting with his idol from overseas, now they dream of replicating the deeds of Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni.</p>

                <h2>Large Heading</h2>

                <p>In many ways, Pakistan’s rise from No. 8 in the ICC ODI rankings to its maiden ICC Champions Trophy title captured the very essence of the tournament. At almost every press conference leading up to the tournament, the general consensus was that the Champions Trophy was one tournament where there were no favourites, and that all teams had an equal chance.</p>

                <p>As things turned out, it wasn’t just lip service, the most incredible example being the Pakistan story. After a demoralising loss to India in its opening game, the least fancied and lowest ranked team in the competition stunned South Africa and sneaked past Sri Lanka to make it to the knockout stages. If that was impressive, what followed was staggering: Pakistan destroyed England and India in its next two matches to complete its dream run.</p>

                <p>But the Pakistan fairytale was just one part of the story. The ICC Champions Trophy 2017 showed that it is a great leveller as there were plenty more unpredictable results. Bangladesh beating New Zealand to make it to its first semi-final in an ICC event, and Sri Lanka smashing India in the group stage proved that the gap between the sides is not too wide on a given day.</p>

                <p>The tournament also surprised many in that it didn’t turn out to be a batsman v batsman contest. There was speculation ahead of the start that bowlers would have tough times on flat pitches, but ironically, the sides that made it to the final were the ones that had the best bowling attacks.</p>

                <p>Scores in excess of 350 were expected to be the norm, but the highest score in the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 was 338, which too came as late as the final. In fact, the Player of the Tournament was Hasan Ali, a bowler.
